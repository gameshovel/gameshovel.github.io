    <h1>Unable to Join Bug</h1>
    <div>December 23, 2024</div>
    <div>
      There is a bug preventing players from continuing to play games that were created 2+ months ago even if they started recently. We are very sorry for the inconvenienceÂ - we know each game is a big investment of time and energy.
    </div>
    <div>
      If you created a game prior to October 13 that hasn't yet started, you will need to cancel and re-created it.
