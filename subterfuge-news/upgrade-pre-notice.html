    <h1>Subterfuge Rewrite</h1>
    <div>
      We expect to release the updated version of Subterfuge in the next ten days. The biggest change is that Subterfuge will again be available on Android. The iOS build has also been updated in order to support crossplay.
    </div>
    <div>
      The new version of Subterfuge is not backwards-compatible with the current live build. Once you upgrade, you will not be able to play previously-created games that are in-progress. If you want to finish your in-progress games, disable auto-updating and do not install the new game until you are ready.
    </div>
    <div>
      We&rsquo;ve done our best to re-create the game identically to the previous version, but there are certainly going to be bugs and changes that we didn&rsquo;t catch during testing. Report these to the Discord and we will work to quickly fix them.
    </div>
    <div>
      This rewrite unlocks the ability for us to start making balance changes towards the end of 2024. We&rsquo;ll start with tuning the specialists. Infiltrator will rise again!
